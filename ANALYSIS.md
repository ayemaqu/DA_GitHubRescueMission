1. In the README the image isn't loaded, its a link that does not load. 
2. In the README, the commit messages aren't descriptive at all, I can't keep track of the changes that were made
3. In the README, there were different sections: skills, about me, project, projects, and contact but there was no content in it. If you clicked on any of them, it wouldn't lead you anywhere except about me (which is still empty). 
4. The Test.ipynb jupyter notebook is invalid - it's not valid
5. Notebooks is spelled wrong "Notbooks"
